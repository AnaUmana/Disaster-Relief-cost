# Disaster-Relief-cost
Project 3 from CMSC 255 course
For my java course I will be needing to create an algorithm
the algorithm calculates the cost of relief efforts.

Completed Code Will accurately output the total cost of supplys when given a population and distance, while also asking if they require air transport.
